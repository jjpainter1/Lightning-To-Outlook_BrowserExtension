# Icons

Place icon files here:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

For now, you can use placeholder icons or create simple icons with a lightning bolt and calendar symbol.

To create quick placeholder icons, you can:
1. Use an online icon generator
2. Create simple PNG files with the required dimensions
3. Use a tool like GIMP, Photoshop, or even Paint

The extension will work without icons, but they improve the user experience.
